README
===========

This shows examples of [Cairo] (http://search.cpan.org/~xaoc/Cairo-1.103/lib/Cairo.pm) module. 
All examples are translation of original samples by Øyvind Kolås [cairo samples](http://cairographics.org/samples/).
For more complex example take a look at analog_clock.pl which implements 
analog clock inspired by pygtk [clock] (http://www.ralph-glass.homepage.t-online.de/clock/readme.html).
